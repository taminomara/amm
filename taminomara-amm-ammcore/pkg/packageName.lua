--- Utilities for parsing package name.
---
--- !doctype module
--- @class ammcore.pkg.packageName
local ns = {}

--- @param name string
--- @return boolean
local function isValidUsername(name)
    return name:match("^[-%w]+$") and not name:match("%-%-") and true
end

--- @param name string
--- @return boolean

--- Parse a package name into separate components.
---
--- Package name consists of up to three components separated by dashes.
---
--- The first component represents a github username. It is optional, and must consist
--- of letters and dashes.
---
--- The second one represents a github repository name. It is mandatory, and must form
--- a valid lua identifier.
---
--- The third component represents a sub-package within a repository, if repository
--- consists of multiple packages. It is optional, and must also form
--- a valid lua identifier.
---
---
--- Examples of package names
--- -------------------------
---
--- Full package name, represents package ``"taminomara-amm-ammcore"``
--- from repository ``"github.com/taminomara/amm"``:
---
--- .. code-block::
---
---            "taminomara-amm-ammcore"
---             ────────┬─ ─┬─ ─────┬─
---    github username ─╯   │       │
---    github repo ─────────╯       │
---    package name ────────────────╯
---
--- Short package name, represents package ``"taminomara-amm"``
--- from repository ``"github.com/taminomara/amm"``:
---
--- .. code-block::
---
---            "taminomara-amm"
---             ────────┬─ ─┬─
---    github username ─╯   │
---    github repo ─────────╯
---
--- Local package ``"example"``, not tied to any repository:
---
--- .. code-block::
---
---            "example"
---             ─────┬─
---    package name ─╯
---
--- Full package name, represents package ``"example-username-repo-package"``
--- from repository ``"github.com/example-username/repo"``:
---
--- .. code-block::
---
---            "example-username-repo-package"
---             ──────────────┬─ ──┬─ ─────┬─
---    github username ───────╯    │       │
---    github repo ────────────────╯       │
---    package name ───────────────────────╯
---
--- .. note::
---
---    Notice that github username contains dashes; such user will not be able
---    to publish ``"example-username-repo"``, because AMM will think that
---    it represents a package from repository ``"github.com/example/username"``.
---
--- @param name string package name.
--- @return boolean ok `true` if name is valid.
--- @return string? user first package name component: github username, if there is any.
--- @return string? repo second package name component, either github repo or a name.
--- @return string? name third package name component, only set for github sub-packages.
