--- The simplest synchronization primitive: one thread signals an event
--- and another threads wait for it.
---
--- `Event` can be though of as having an internal flag. One thread
--- can set this to `true` using the `set` method. Another thread
--- can wait for the flag to become `true` using the `await` method.
---
--- Initially, flag starts as `false`.
---
--- @class Event: ammcore.class.Base
ns.Event = class.create("Event")

function ns.Event:__init()
    --- @private
    self._promise, self._resolve = ns.promise()
end

--- Set the event flag to `false`.
---
--- Threads that call `await` after the event was reset
function ns.Event:reset()
    if self:isSet() then
        self._promise, self._resolve = ns.promise()
    end
end

--- Set the event flag to `true`.
---
--- All threads waiting for it to become true are awakened.
--- Threads that call `await` once the flag is true will not block at all.
function ns.Event:set()
    if not self:isSet() then
        self._resolve(nil)

--- Get the event flag.

--- Wait for the event flag to become `true`.
