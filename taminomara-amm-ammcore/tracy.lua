--- Wrappers for tracy library.
---
--- These functions don't do anything when FIN compiled without tracy.
---
--- !doctype module
--- @class ammcore.tracy
local ns = {}

--- Begin tracy zone.
function ns.zoneBegin() end

--- End tracy zone.
function ns.zoneEnd() end

--- Begin named tracy zone.
---
--- Zone names should not contain any runtime data, as they will be used
--- for grouping zones in profiler. Use `ZoneName` if you want to set a dynamic
--- zone name.
function ns.zoneBeginN(name) end

--- Add an additional zone text/description.
---
--- A zone can have multiple descriptions, all of them will be displayed in profiler.
---
--- @param text string
function ns.zoneText(text) end

--- Like `zoneText`, but accepts a format string and format parameters.
---
--- This is equivalent to:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    tracy.zoneText(string.format(text, ...))
function ns.zoneTextF(text, ...) end

--- Add an additional zone name.
---
--- Zone can have a dynamic name that will be displayed in profiler,
--- but will not affect zone grouping.
---
--- @param text string
function ns.zoneName(text) end

--- Like `zoneName`, but accepts a format string and format parameters.
---
--- This is equivalent to:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    tracy.zoneName(string.format(text, ...))
function ns.zoneNameF(text, ...) end

--- Send a message that will be displayed in the profiler.
---
--- @param text string
function ns.message(text) end

--- Like `message`, but accepts a format string and format parameters.
---
--- This is equivalent to:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    tracy.message(string.format(text, ...))
function ns.messageF(text, ...) end

--- Begin tracy zone with stack capturing.
---
--- @param depth integer
function ns.zoneBeginS(depth) end

--- Begin named tracy zone with stack capturing.
---
--- @param name string
--- @param depth integer
function ns.zoneBeginNS(name, depth) end
