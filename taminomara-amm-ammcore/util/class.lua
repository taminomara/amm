--- Support library for OOP in lua.
---
---
--- # Creating a class
---
--- You can create a new class by calling `class.create`.
--- Unless specified, the new class will inherit `class.Base`,
--- so you can annotate it accordingly:
---
--- ```
--- --- @class Foo: class.Base
--- local Foo = class.create("Foo")
---
--- function Foo:doSomething()
---     print("Doing something in Foo")
--- end
--- ```
---
---
--- # Instantiating a class
---
--- You can now create instances of your class by calling `New`.
--- Note that all class methods (i.e. methods that accept class as a first
--- parameter, rather than a class instance) start with a capital letter:
---
--- ```
--- local foo = Foo:New()
--- ```
---
---
--- # Inheriting a class
---
--- You can provide a base class to `class.create` to inherit from it:
---
--- ```
--- --- @class Bar: Foo
--- local Bar = class.create("Bar", Foo)
--- ```
---
--- You can override methods and properties of the base class:
---
--- ```
--- function Bar:doSomething()
---     print("Doing something in Bar")
---     -- Call the super function.
---     Foo.doSomething(self)
--- end
--- ```
---
--- Similarly, you can override `New`:
---
--- ```
--- function Bar:New()
---     -- Replace `self` with a new instance of `Bar`.
---     self = Foo.New(self)
---     -- Initialize the new instance.
---     self.beep = "boop"
---     -- Don't forget to return `self`.
---     return self
--- end
--- ```
---
---
--- # Declaring class methods
---
--- Class methods take class as a first parameter, instead of a class instance.
--- Lua doesn't distinguish between normal methods and class methods,
--- so it is possible to pass an instance to a class method:
---
--- ```
--- function Foo:ClassMethod()
---     print(self)
--- end
---
--- Foo:ClassMethod() --> prints `Foo`
--- Foo:New():ClassMethod() --> prints `Foo()`
--- ```
---
--- Here, `ClassMethod` expects that `self` is `Foo`, but instead
--- it is an instance of `Foo`.
---
--- To avoid errors, you can always get the class by its instance using the `__class`
--- attribute:
---
--- ```
--- function Foo:ClassMethod()
---     self = self.__class -- Make sure we're working with a class.
---     print(self)
--- end
---
--- Foo:ClassMethod() --> prints `Foo`
--- Foo:New():ClassMethod() --> also prints `Foo`
--- ```
---
---
--- # Declaring metamethods
---
--- You can declare metamethods which will be applied to class instances:
---
--- ```
--- Point = class.create("Point")
---
--- function Point:New(x, y)
---     self = class.Base.New(self)
---     self.x, self.y = x, y
---     return self
--- end
---
--- function Point:__tostring()
---     return string.format("Point(%s, %s)", self.x, self.y)
--- end
---
--- print(Point:New(0, 0)) --> prints `Point(0, 0)`
--- ```
---
--- Metamethods only act on class instances:
---
--- ```
--- print(Point) --> doesn't call `__tostring`, just prints `Point`
--- ```
---
--- Note that you should declare all metamethods before subclassing or instantiating
--- a class, otherwise they will not be inherited correctly.
