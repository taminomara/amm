--- Synchronization context, keeps track of outdated functional components
--- and their children.
---
--- When a functional component is outdated, we want to re-render it, and then update
--- all non-memo functional components within it. However, if a functional component
--- uses children that were passed from outside, and those children are not outdated,
--- we don't want to re-render them.
---
--- To deal with all of this, we keep a stack of all functional components we've
--- encountered so far, and their ``outdated`` status. When we encounter a new
--- functional component, we see if the top-most component in our stack
--- is outdated, and decide if we need to push the new component onto the stack
--- and re-render it. When we encounter a child node, we look up ``outdated`` state
--- of the component that created it, and push it onto the stack, thus replacing
--- the current ``outdated`` flag.
