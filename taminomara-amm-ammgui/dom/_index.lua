--- Lightweight DOM structure.
---
--- AmmGui uses react-like shadow DOM approach. Nodes declared in this file are simple
--- lightweight tables containing settings for an associated `~ammgui.component`.
---
--- On each rendering cycle, we compare settings from these DOM nodes to settings
--- currently assigned to each node's `~ammgui.component`. If settings have changed,
--- we know that we need to recalculate CSS and layout. Otherwise, we can use
--- previously calculated layout to speed up rendering process.

--- Create a functional component.
---
--- Functional components are a way to separate GUI pages into independent blocks.
---
--- Each functional component consists of a single function that produces DOM nodes.
--- When used, you pass parameters for this function; AmmGui then checks
--- if these parameters had changed since the last interface update, and, if they did,
--- invokes the component's function to generate an updated DOM.
---
--- .. warning::
---
---    Functional component's result is cached. To ensure proper cache invalidation,
---    functional components should be pure. That is, their result should only depend
---    on the input parameters; it should stay the same as long as parameters
---    stay the same.
---
---    Follow these rules to ensure that your component is pure:
---
---    - never modify ``params`` or any value within it:
---
---      .. code-block:: lua
---
---         local greeting = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---             -- ðŸš« Modifying `params`.
---             params.name = params.name or "mysterious person" -- ðŸ”´ modification is not allowed.
---
---             -- âœ… Creating a new variable.
---             name = params.name or "mysterious person"
---         end)
---
---    - if you've instantiated a functional component, don't modify its parameters
---      afterwards:
---
---      .. code-block:: lua
---
---         -- ðŸš« Modifying `params` after a functional component was instantiated.
---         local greetingParams = { name = "Alice" }
---         local greetingNode1 = greeting(greetingParams)
---         greetingParams.name = "Bob" -- ðŸ”´ modification is not allowed.
---         local greetingNode2 = greeting(greetingParams)
---
---         -- âœ… Creating a new table for every functional component instantiation:
---         local greetingNode1 = greeting { name = "Alice" }
---         local greetingNode2 = greeting { name = "Bob" }
---
---    - don't modify DOM nodes that were passed to other functions, or were returned
---      from other functions:
---
---      .. code-block:: lua
---
---         -- ðŸš« Modifying a node that was returned from somewhere else.
---         local node = someFunctionThatReturnsANode()
---         node.ref = ctx:useRef() -- ðŸ”´ modification is not allowed.
---
---         -- âœ… Wrapping a node without modifying it.
---         local node = dom.list {
---             ref = ctx:useRef(),
---             someFunctionThatReturnsANode()
---         }
---
---         -- ðŸš« Modifying a node that you've created after passing it somewhere.
---         local text = dom.text { "Hello!" }
---         local div1 = dom.div { text }
---         text[1] = "Goodbye." -- ðŸ”´ modification is not allowed.
---         local div2 = dom.div { text }
---
---         -- âœ… Modifying a node that you've created before using it somewhere else.
---         local div = dom.div {}
---         for _, item in ipairs(array) do
---             table.insert(div, dom.text { item })
---         end
---
---         -- ðŸš« Modifying a node that you've created after returning it.
---         local greeting = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---             local heading = dom.h1 { "Hello, ", params.name or "world", "!" }
---             local button = dom.button {
---                 onClick = function() -- ðŸ”´ `onClick` will run after `return`...
---                     table.insert(heading, " clicked!") -- ðŸ”´ ...therefore modification is not allowed.
---                 end
---                 "Click me!"
---             }
---
---             return dom.div { heading, button }
---         end)
---
---         -- âœ… Using functional context to modify state.
---         local greeting = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---             local clicked, setClicked = ctx:useState(false)
---
---             local heading = dom.h1 { "Hello, ", params.name or "world", "!" }
---             if clicked then
---                 -- ðŸŸ¢ `heading` was created by us, we can modify it before returning
---                 -- or passing it to another function.
---                 table.insert(heading, " clicked!")
---             end
---
---             local button = dom.button {
---                 onClick = function()
---                     setClicked(true) -- ðŸŸ¢ using a special mutator returned from `useState`.
---                 end
---                 "Click me!"
---             }
---
---             return dom.div { heading, button }
---         end)
---
--- **Example:**
---
--- Let's create a simple component that greets a user:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    local greeting = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---        return dom.h1 { "Hello, ", params.name or "world", "!" }
---    end)
---
--- We can now reuse this component elsewhere:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    -- This is a simple block-level DOM node:
---    local greetingNode = greeting { name = "stranger" }
---
---    -- We can nest it, like any other node:
---    local div = dom.div { greetingNode }
---
--- **Example: using keys with functional components**
---
--- We can always use ``key`` and ``ref`` properties when using
--- a functional component. Their values will not be passed
--- to the component's function.
---
--- Here, we make a list of two ``greeting`` nodes. To make sure
--- that the list can be properly synchronized regardless of the order of greetings,
--- we add keys to our nodes.
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    local multipleGreetings = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---        return dom.list {
---            greeting { key = "alice", name = "Alice" },
---            greeting { key = "bob", name = "Bob" },
---        }
---    end)
---
--- **Example: functional component with body**
---
--- We can make functional components that accept other nodes as parameters,
--- and use them in their body.
---
--- For example, let's make a component that displays an admonition.
--- We will accept an array of block nodes as admonition's body. We will also
--- accept an optional parameter ``title``.
---
--- To extract nodes from parameters and group them into a single node,
--- we will use a helper function called `list`.
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    local admonition = dom.Functional(function(ctx, params)
---        return dom.div {
---            class = "admonition",
---            dom.h1 { params.title or "Note" },
---            dom.list(params),
---        }
---    end)
---
--- We can now use our ``admonition`` component like so:
---
--- .. code-block:: lua
---
---    admonition {
---        title = "Warning",
---        dom.p { "This is admonition's body." }
---        dom.p { "We can pass multiple nodes here." }
---        dom.p { "All of them will end up in a list." }
---    }
---
--- Note that every node passed in as a child will be wrapped into a special
--- wrapper node. This allows AmmGui to track where the children came from,
--- and optimize DOM synchronization.
---
--- .. tip::
---
---    To get better type inference with Lua Language Server, declare component's
---    implementation as a separate function, and annotate its parameter types.
---    To further improve things, you can split ``params`` annotation into
---    a separate class inherited from `ammgui.dom.FunctionalParams`
---    or `ammgui.dom.FunctionalParamsWithChildren`:
---
---    .. code-block:: lua
---
---       --- @class _GreetingParams: ammgui.dom.FunctionalParams
---       --- @field name string
---
---       --- Implementation for the `greeting` component.
---       --- @param ctx ammgui.dom.Context
---       --- @param params _GreetingParams
---       local function _greeting(ctx, params)
---           return dom.h1 { "Hello, ", params.name, "!" }
---       end
---
---       --- The component itself.
---       local greeting = dom.Functional(_greeting)
---
---    With these annotations, Lua Language Server will not allow calling ``greeting``
---    without ``name``:
---
---    .. code-block:: lua
---
---       local node = greeting {} --> error: Missing required fields
---                                --> in type `_GreetingParams`: `name`.

--- This is a simplified version of `Canvas`. It accepts two parameters:

---
---   It takes a text measuring service as a single parameter
---   (see `ammgui._impl.context.textMeasure.TextMeasure`).
---
---   It can return an arbitrary number of values that will be passed on ``onDraw``;
---
--- - ``onDraw``: a callback that's invoked during an interface redraw.

---   It takes two parameters; first is ``gpu``, second is canvas size.
---
---   Additionally, anything returned from ``onPrepareLayout`` will be passed as third
